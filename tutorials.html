            Welcome to the tutorials page. This is
            where I will post tutorials about how to
            use certain tools like OpenGL, or a programming
            language. The main 3 languages I will be making
            tutorials on will be C++, C#, and JavaScript(maybe Java).
            I am NOT a professional programmer, this is purely for
            passion, so I hope you will not critisize me in my methods.
            If I make a tutorial on something, I probably will not be
            an expert in it, so I will recommend helpful sites instead
            of just giving my word. When I make these tutorials, I will
            at least try to the best of my ability to explain the code.

        <h3 id="space-headers">C++ Tutorial 01</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            To start out with C++, write the following code:
        </h5>
        <div class="code">
            <h5 id="writing-space">
                #include &ltiostream&gt<br>
                <br>
                int main()<br>
                {<br>
            &nbsp   std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;<br>
                }<br>
        </div>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            The #include tells our program that we want to 
            use the tools within the file specified. std::cout
            tells our program that we want to print something
            out to the console, using &lt&lt tells the program
            that we are outputting information and not taking 
            it in. You want whatever you are printing out to
            be in "" or '' (unless it is a variable). std::endl
            tells our program that we want to make a new line.

                Variables
            </h4>
            <h5 id="writing-space">
                In C++ we have variables. Variables are important
                because they allow us to work with numbers and make
                complex calculations. I may not know all of the variables,
                but I know the main ones. The first variable you have is an
                int, it is defined like this:
            </h5>
            <div class="code">
                <h5 id="writing-space">
                    int i = 10;
                </h5>
            </div>
            <h5 id="writing-space">
                In this example, we have set i to 10. In C++
                it is important to define variables like this,
                even if you set the variable to be 0. The reason
                for this is because C++ is heavy on memory managment.
                So you don't want to be creating variables with no value.
                If you set the variable to NULL, that is the same thing
                as not setting it, you can also set the variable after
                defining it, but you should do this <b>before</b> using
                the variable. You can also define variables pretty much anywhere
                in your code.
            </h5>
            <h5 id="writing-space">
                Another variable is a string, it is defined like this:
            </h5>
            <div class="comment">
                <h5 id="writing-space">
                    //Make sure you have iostream included in the file
                </h5>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <h5 id="writing-space">
                    std::string = "Hello World!";
                </h5>
            </div>
            <h5 id="writing-space">
                Another variable is a string, it is defined like this:
