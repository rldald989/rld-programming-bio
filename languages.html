            Hi, I am rldald989, the language that I am best at developing in is c++,
             that is the language that I like to write any heavily based graphics
              programs or programs in general in. C++ is by far the language I most 
              use because of the language I had
             started out in, c#.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">C#</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            The first language I had learned was c# when trying to learn
            how to code for unity projects, I had come aross a brackey's
            tutorial, although most of my knowledge about regular c# isn't
            there, I can use Unity c# pretty well.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Java</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            With my experience with c based programming languages such as c++ and c#,
            learning java was pretty straight-forward and simple. I had wanted to learn java
            to make minecraft mods, but ended up writing a game based off of a tutorial.
            Java is something I can write in easily, sort of like a simplified version of c++.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Python</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            Here is where we get to the programming languages I don't like to use, or rarely use.
            Python is not a language I would choose to use because of it's syntax. It has good use
            conditions for things like AI and is good for beginners, but I wouldn't use it for the
            kind of projects I work on. In general, I'm not too good at python because I don't use it
            often and it's syntax is so far from c; 
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Rust</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            Rust is another one of those languages I don't like or use that much. Apparently it
            has a good compiler, but I haven't messed around with the language too heavily, so I
            wouldn't know. It's variables are pretty simple, but there are some things like mut
            that I don't understand. It's a pretty good programming language for people who want to
            use it, and is pretty well developed and wide-ranged in use cases, but because of the 
            syntax, types, and variables(etc.), it is a language I don't and probably will not use.
