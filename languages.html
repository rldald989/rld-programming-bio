        <h3 id="space-headers">The Languages</h3>
        <h3 id="language-headers">C++</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            Hi, I am rldald989, the language that I am best at developing in is C++,
             that is the language that I like to write any heavily graphics based
              programs or programs in general in. C++ is by far the language I most 
              use because of the language I had
             started out in, C#.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">C#</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            The first language I had learned was C# when trying to learn
            how to code for unity projects, I had come across a Brackeys
            tutorial, although most of my knowledge about regular C# isn't
            valid, I can use Unity C# pretty well.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Java</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            With my experience with C based programming languages such as C++ and C#,
            learning Java was pretty straight-forward and simple. I had wanted to learn Java
            to make Minecraft mods, but ended up writing a game based off of a tutorial.
            Java is something I can write in easily, sort of like a simplified version of C++.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Javascript</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            JavaScript was pretty easy to learn since I had experience with languages like Python, Rust,
            and the C based programming languages. The first sort of application for using JavaScript for me
            was making video games(web games). I learned how to use JavaScript by watching a video on it and
            following a tutorial on making snake.
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Python</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            Here is where we get to the programming languages I don't like to use, or rarely use.
            Python is not a language I would choose to use because of it's syntax. It has good use
            cases for things like AI and is good for beginners, but I wouldn't use it for the
            kind of projects I work on. In general, I don't Python use too often because
             it's syntax is so far from C based programming languages and what I want to use it
             for usually doesn't work. 
        </h5>
        <h3 id="language-headers">Rust</h3>
        <h5 id="writing-space">
            Rust is another one of those languages I don't like or use that much. Apparently it
            has a good compiler, but I haven't messed around with the language too heavily, so I
            wouldn't know. It's variables are pretty simple, but there are some variables or types like mut
            that I don't understand. It's a pretty good programming language for people who want to
            use it, and is pretty well developed and wide-ranged in use cases, but because of the 
            syntax, types, and variables(etc.), it is a language I don't and probably will not use.
